## Opening Phenomenon
<!-- Purpose: Establish the systemic transition using formal evidence without narrative. -->
This entry records a public reporting cycle anchored by successive filings for The Trade Desk, Inc. The issuer is present in the archive through Form 10-Q and Form 8-K submissions that define the reporting perimeter. The record is not a narrative of performance; it is a formal sequence of disclosure events.

The primary anchor is Form 10-Q filed 2025-11-06. That filing establishes a quarterly reporting frame and extends the continuity of the issuer's public obligations. The record aligns with later Form 8-K filings that mark additional reportable events within the same period.

The canonical URL is an external observation point. The operative evidence resides in SEC EDGAR, which functions as the institutional archive for the issuer's reporting cycle. This document treats those filings as the controlling evidence set.

## Historical Positioning
<!-- Purpose: Place the record within a filing sequence and dated milestones. -->
The filing sequence spans multiple dates in 2025. A Form 10-Q was filed on 2025-05-08, followed by another Form 10-Q filed on 2025-08-07. A subsequent Form 10-Q filed on 2025-11-06 establishes the latest quarterly frame within this cycle.

Alongside the quarterly reports, Form 8-K filings appear in the archive on 2025-11-06 and 2025-12-15. These filings operate as event-bound disclosures within the same reporting horizon. The dates are preserved as mechanical markers rather than interpretive signals.

The record remains anchored to the filing calendar rather than narrative time. It situates the issuer within a structured reporting cadence that is defined by regulatory timing and disclosure requirements.

## Mechanism of Power
<!-- Purpose: Describe the institutional mechanism and disclosure regime as the governing force. -->
The mechanism at work is the SEC reporting regime. A Form 10-Q is a periodic obligation that converts internal statements into a public record. A Form 8-K is an event trigger that inserts additional disclosures into the archive outside the regular cadence.

Each filing is a boundary condition. The archive constrains what is known by requiring specific formats and by fixing dates of submission. This mechanism operates independently of narrative intent. It enforces continuity by requiring subsequent filings as long as the issuer remains public.

The filings in this record demonstrate the continuity of that regime. They establish the issuer's presence in the archive and define the window within which later disclosures must appear. The mechanism is repetitive by design, and the repetition is the evidence.

## Agents Involved
<!-- Purpose: Identify formal agents and gatekeepers as they appear in the record. -->
The issuer is The Trade Desk, Inc., named in the SEC filings and represented by its ticker in the public market system. The issuer's agency is expressed through formal submissions that comply with filing schemas.

The SEC archive is the canonical gatekeeper. It does not interpret; it records. The archive confers status on filings by accepting them into the system and indexing them under the issuer's CIK. This institutional function is the core agent behind the persistence of the record.

Other actors are present only through formal traces. The filings are the authoritative artifacts. This document does not extend beyond them.

## Structural Question
<!-- Purpose: Close with an archival question that preserves institutional continuity. -->
The record preserves a sequence of filings that sustain public status and ongoing disclosure.

What structural obligations become binding when periodic reports and event reports are treated as a continuous public record?
