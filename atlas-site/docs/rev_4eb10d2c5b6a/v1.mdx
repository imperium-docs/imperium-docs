## Opening Phenomenon
<!-- Purpose: Establish the systemic transition using formal evidence without narrative. -->
This entry records the transition of LEHMAN ABS CORP GOLDMAN SACHS CAP 1 SEC BACKED SER 2004-6 into a public issuer through an IPO process governed by filings.

The primary anchor is FILING filed on record, which consolidates the offering into a public instrument.

The record aligns with the exchange listing referenced in the sources, marking the operational shift into the public market framework.

## Historical Positioning
<!-- Purpose: Place the record within a filing sequence and dated milestones. -->
The filing sequence establishes a dated trail that defines the path to admission.

The recorded filings document the progression from registration to final prospectus.

This sequence is preserved without narrative, as a mechanical transition between private status and public disclosure.

## Mechanism of Power
<!-- Purpose: Describe the institutional mechanism and disclosure regime as the governing force. -->
The IPO mechanism enforces disclosure, pricing discipline, and ongoing reporting obligations.

Registration, amendment, and final prospectus filings operate as the formal controls that bind issuer conduct to public rules.

Once listed, ongoing reports extend the record into a continuous archive of required statements.

## Agents Involved
<!-- Purpose: Identify formal agents and gatekeepers as they appear in the record. -->
The issuer is identified through its filings and ticker designation, and acts within the constraints of the filing system.

The SEC archive serves as the canonical repository, and the exchange listing functions as the operational gatekeeper.

No discretionary interpretation is preserved here; only the documented institutional roles are retained.

## Structural Question
<!-- Purpose: Close with an archival question that preserves institutional continuity. -->
What obligations become structurally binding when the filing sequence resolves into a permanent listing state?
