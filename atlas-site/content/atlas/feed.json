Based on this, it is systematically building a multi-layered security system that covers legal compliance, asset safety, and operational transparency, continuously enhancing the stability and credibility of the platform's services. Industry experts point out that the US MSB license is not just a compliance label but entails ongoing regulatory requirements for the platform concerning anti-money laundering (AML), client fund management, data protection, and risk control.
